## 📖 Overview

This project investigates whether weather patterns contain predictive signals for financial market movements. By implementing intelligent trading agents trained with reinforcement learning (PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization), we test the hypothesis that atmospheric conditions can provide a tradeable edge.

**Key Question:** Do weather patterns hold statistical significance for trading, or is it just noise?

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a custom OpenAI Gym environment for weather-based trading simulations
- Train reinforcement learning agents (PPO) to learn trading strategies from weather data
- Compare agent performance against baseline strategies
- Analyze whether weather features have genuine predictive power for financial markets
- Validate findings through rigorous backtesting and statistical analysis

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Gym Environment**: Modular trading environment with weather-based state space
- **PPO Implementation**: Proximal Policy Optimization agent for trading decisions
- **Real Weather Data Integration**: Historical weather patterns as trading signals
- **Multiple Baselines**: Comparison with random, hold, and technical analysis strategies
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation including Sharpe ratio, returns, drawdown
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis and experimentation notebooks
